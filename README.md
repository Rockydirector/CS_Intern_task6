# Task 6 – Create a Strong Password and Evaluate Its Strength

## **Objective**
The goal of this task is to understand what makes a password strong, evaluate its strength using online tools, and identify best practices for password creation.

## **Process**
1. Created multiple passwords with different complexity levels (weak, medium, strong, passphrase).
2. Tested each password using free online tools such as:
   - [passwordmeter.com](https://passwordmeter.com)
   - [Kaspersky Password Checker](https://password.kaspersky.com/)
3. Recorded scores, strength ratings, and feedback for each password.
4. Analyzed results to identify what makes a password strong.
5. Compiled a list of password security best practices.

## **Password Strength Testing Results**

| Password                  | Score (%) | Strength       | Feedback                           |
|---------------------------|-----------|---------------|-------------------------------------|
| rocky123                  | 20%       | Weak          | Too short, no symbols, predictable |
| Rocky@2025                | 65%       | Medium        | Good mix, but could be longer      |
| R0cky!nF0sec#452           | 95%       | Strong        | Excellent length & complexity      |
| BlueElephant#Night42      | 90%       | Strong        | Good length, easy to remember      |
| gH@93pQ!xM1&yZ#tR          | 100%      | Very Strong   | Extremely secure                   |

## **Best Practices for Strong Passwords**
- Use at least **12–16 characters**.
- Combine **uppercase letters, lowercase letters, numbers, and special symbols**.
- Avoid dictionary words, common phrases, and personal details.
- Use a **unique password** for each account.
- Consider using **passphrases** for memorability and security.
- Use a **password manager** to store and generate strong passwords.
- Enable **multi-factor authentication (MFA)** wherever possible.

## **Conclusion**
Password strength is a vital component of cybersecurity. Strong passwords are long, complex, and unique, making them significantly harder for attackers to crack. Testing passwords with online tools helps identify weaknesses and improve security. Combining strong passwords with MFA and a password manager offers the best protection against modern cyber threats.
